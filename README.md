<h1>Some Paragraphs</h1>

<p>This is our first ever paragraph. It's not much to look at but it is a good place to start. It will all build from here.</p>

<p>This is another paragraph. You'll notice that it is separated from the first one by a small amount of space.</p>

<p>This is a paragragh    with several spaces in it. See how it displays however.</p>

<p>Orbitting this at a distance of roughly ninety-two million miles is an <b>utterly insignificant</b> little blue-green planet whose ape-descended life forms are so <b>amazingly primitive</b> that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea.</p>

<p>On the day of the <u>Great On-Turning</u> two soberly dressed programmers with briefcases arrived and were shown discreetly into the office. They were aware that this day they would represent <u>their entire race</u> in it's greatest moment.</p>

<p>In marched a squad of about a dozen men dressed in the remnants of their Golgafrincham 3<sup>rd</sup> Regiment dress uniforms. About half of them still carried Kill-O-Zap guns.</p>

<p>There is an art, it says, or rather, a knack to flying. The knack lies in learning how to throw yourself at the ground and miss. Pick a nice day, <sub>[The HitchHikers Guide to the Galaxy]</sub> suggests, and try it.</p>

<p>The first non-absolute number is the number of people for whom the table is reserved.</p>

<hr>

<p>The second non-absolute number is the given time of arrival, which is now known to be one of those most bizarre of concepts.</p>

<p>His mouth started to speak, <b><u>but his brain</u></b> decided it hadn't got anything to say yet and shut it again.</p>

<p>His brain then <b><u>started to contend</b></u> with the problem of what his eyes told it they were looking at, but in doing so relinquished control of the mouth which promptly fell open again.</p>

<p>Once more gathering up the jaw, <b>his brain <u>lost control</b> of his left hand</u> which then wandered around in an aimless fashion.</p>

<p>Clubs is the character code for a clubs symbol - &clubs; or &#9827;</p>

<p>Dagger is the character code for a dagger symbol - &dagger; or &#8224;</p>

<pre>
This is     a     sentence with
        some bizarre formatting.

<p>And the Lord spake, saying, 'First shalt thou take out the Holy Pin. Then, shalt thou count to three. No more. No less. Three shalt be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be three. Four shalt thou not count, neither count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three. Five is right out. Once at the number three, being the third number to be reached, then, lobbest thou thy Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch towards thy foe, who, being naughty in My sight, shall snuff it.'</p>
